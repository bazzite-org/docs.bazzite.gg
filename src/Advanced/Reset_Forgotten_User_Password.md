2. Load SELinux policy

   `/sbin/load_policy`

3. Enter your new password (i.e. `passwd bazzite`)

## Not working?

Many users forget steps regarding SELinux because of habits. If you've made everything but SELinux steps above, the file `/etc/shadow` will be unreadable or unreachable by any process.

The good way to check if `/etc/shadow` is in bad SELinux configuration is to execute following command:

`ls -Z /etc/shadow`

![ls -Z /etc/shadow|690x334](../img/Unlabeled_Etc_Shadow.png)

You should also notice _unlabeled_t_ on your side.
You now have to fix the label on `/etc/shadow` with command below:

`restorecon -v /etc/shadow`

And then check result again with `ls -Z /etc/shadow`, which should lead to:

`system_u:object_r:shadow_t:s0   /etc/shadow`

Now the system is ready and you can reboot with `/sbin/reboot -ff`.
