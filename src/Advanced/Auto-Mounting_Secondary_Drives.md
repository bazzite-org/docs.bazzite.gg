## Setup an auto-mounting partition

1. Open Gnome Disks, should have an icon like this. ![GNOME|50x50, 50%](../img/GNOME_Disks_icon.png)

2. Wipe the partition you want to use, then use the leftover to create a new one.

3. Give it a name and a filesystem.

Now reboot, your partition should be mounted automatically. Should appear under `/run/media/system/PARTITION_NAME`.

Append `,user,exec` at the end if doesnt work properly

### Drives will not auto-mount despite being BTRFS/ext4 (Requests authentication every boot to mount)

1. Mount the target disk(s).

2. Open Gnome Disks and navigate to the target disk.

3. Click on Additional Partition Options > Edit Mount Options.

4. Ensure "User Session Defaults" is FALSE and "Mount at system startup" is TRUE, then click "Ok"

5. Repeat for any additional disks. You can confirm this worked by checking your Fstab file and seeing that the appropriate UUIDs have been added. `sudo cat /etc/fstab`
