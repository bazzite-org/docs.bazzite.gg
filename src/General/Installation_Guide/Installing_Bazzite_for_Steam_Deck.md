> Pre-requisites and steps before installing Bazzite.

#### Installer Requirements

!!! note

    Bazzite requires a stable internet connection with no bandwidth cap in place.

    XHCI has to be set as the USB Mode for the Steam Deck for our ISO to boot! If it is set to DRD, please change it in your BIOS settings.

## Installation Guide

> The part of the guide that requires the most effort.

### 1. Download and Flash Bazzite

- Download [Bazzite](https://download.bazzite.gg) after choosing the Steam Deck ISO with our Image Picker tool.
- Flash Bazzite to your bootable medium.
- Eject drive.

### 2. Boot Installation Medium

Hold the 'Volume Down' (<kbd>-</kbd>) button and click the Power Button, and when you hear the chime, let go of both buttons, and you'll be booted into the Boot Manager.

When you get to the boot menu, select your bootable device to boot into the Bazzite installer.

### 3. Installer

!!! note "Installation without keyboard"

    If you do not have a usb physical keyboard connected, do **NOT** press "_User Creation_", since it will remove the default username and password, and you will be unable to type a username or password without a physical keyboard.

    **default user**: `bazzite`
    **default password**: `bazzite`

### GRUB Menu

![Rollbacks|690x402, 50%](../../img/GRUB_Menu.png)

The first boot will show a screen showing your current and last deployment. It is important to note that the GRUB menu can be used to rollback Bazzite deployments if you encounter issues.

Read more about this in the [Updates, Rollback, and Rebasing documentation](../../Installing_and_Managing_Software/Updates_Rollbacks_and_Rebasing/index.md).

### Login to Steam & Reboot Device

Login to Steam then **reboot** your device when you finish setting up your device during the first-boot process.

#### Setting Up Steam Gaming Mode
