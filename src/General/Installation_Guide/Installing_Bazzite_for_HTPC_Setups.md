## Installation Guide

> The part of the guide that requires the most effort.

### 1. Download and Flash Bazzite

- Download [Bazzite](https://download.bazzite.gg) after choosing the correct ISO for your hardware with our Image Picker tool.
- Flash Bazzite to your bootable medium.
- Eject drive.

#### Current Fedora Atomic Desktop Users

Current [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) users can rebase with the terminal command listed on the website under the "Existing Fedora Atomic Desktop Users" section and can skip the next step.

### 2. Boot Bazzite

- Connect your bootable medium to your device and boot into it.
- After connecting the device, boot into the Bazzite installer.
- This depends on your motherboard hardware, but most of the time it could be a function keys like <kbd>F9</kbd> or similar.
  - Sometimes you need to consult the manual, look up your device online, or read any hotkeys that appear when you boot your PC.
    - Alternatively change the BIOS settings to boot with your bootable device first before your current storage, but this is **not recommended** to keep enabled after installing Bazzite.
- Verify the media correctly and proceed to the installer.

### Dual Boot Preliminary Setup + Post-Setup Guide

The first boot will show a screen showing your current and last deployment.  It is important to note that the GRUB menu can be used to rollback Bazzite deployments if you encounter issues.

Read more about this in the [Updates, Rollback, and Rebasing documentation](../../Installing_and_Managing_Software/Updates_Rollbacks_and_Rebasing/index.md).

### Login to Steam & Reboot Device

Login to Steam then **reboot** your device when you finish setting up your device during the first-boot process.

#### Setup Steam Gaming Mode

![Steam Gaming Mode Setup|690x442, 50%](../../img/pLvHB1NAMlb3ghsR72q7l9Auj8B.jpeg)

After completing all of the above, then your next boot will be in Steam Gaming Mode which requires additional setup for Steam.
